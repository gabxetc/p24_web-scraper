# p24_web-scraper

This is a coding project tony gave me. It is a property 24 web scraper

How to use the software.

Step 1:
1. In VS Code, open the terminal.
2. Run the following command: node index.js in the terminal to run the server.
3. Once your server is running. Go to base.html, right click anywhere on the script and "Open with live server".
OR
3. Go into file explorer and open base.html with Google Chrome by right clicking on it and saying "Open with".
4. By now your server should be live and you should have a webpage open with a property 24 logo on it.

Step 2:
1. In a new tab, google property 24 and go onto Property24's website.
2. In the search bar of the Property 24's website, enter the location/area you would like to have scrapped for information.
3. Click on the search icon once you are satisfied with the area you would like scraped
4. Once the webpage has loaded with the area of interest. Copy the url of the webpage with the filtered data i.e. location

Step 3:
1. Go onto the base.html's website that you previously opened through VS Code or file explorer.
2. Admire Gaby's hard work
3. Enter your name in the text box
4. Paste the url you copied from Propetry 24's website into the text box that says "Link"
